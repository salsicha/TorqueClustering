# <h1>The official implementation of Torque Clustering Algorithm</h1>

<h2>Autonomous clustering by fast find of mass and distance peaks</h2>

<h3>Usage and implementation</h3>

This project is for the reproduction of the results of the Torque Clustering algorithm based on Matlab2019b.

You need to put all the ".m" files into one folder.

Due to the space limits of Github, we put all the data sets on the [google drive:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ddvBAfxtR9wKKM7IAhNfD9HQ_kyhmceD/view?usp=sharing), the txt version of the data sets is also [available:](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cPz7KvnLCPx-j6nWOl-juOMTtIWlmW3Y/view?usp=sharing).

**You may refer to the file containing "Run" in its name for a detailed guide on how to use Torque Clustering.**

The explanation of each "Run" file:

TorqueClustering_Run.m and TorqueClustering_Run_ImageClustering.m: The codes for the reproduction of the results in the main article.

TorqueClustering_Run_Supplementary.m: The codes for the reproduction of the results in the supplementary information.

If you want to use the fast version (TorqueClustering_kdtree) of Torque Clustering for large datasets (for which computing pairwise distance matrix won't fit in your memory), you need to install [flann library](https://github.com/flann-lib/flann) based on your environment.
